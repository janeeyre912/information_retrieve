- Project #1 – Use NLTK library and other python library like Beautiful Soup to parse Reuters collection (Reuter’s-21578 corpus) into documents, articles, tokens, stems. Removed stop words indexed in indexer.
- Project #2 – Create a naive indexer, a single term querying processor and a compressed index.
